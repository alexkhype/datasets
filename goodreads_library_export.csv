Lugares comunes por doquier, frases trilladas, palabras domingueras. Nomás para que se den una idea:<br/><br/><blockquote> La noche se dilataba. La lluvia había dejado paso a la reciedumbre de una tormenta eléctrica que horrorizaba los silencios, y la agonía de la luz de la lámpara enmascaraba cada objeto de la habitación. Ella le ofreció algo de comer: una lata de conservas con carne y frituras precocidas. El aspecto de las viandas era desolador, pero Rulfo tenía apetito. Sus ojos también estaban hambrientos, aunque devoraban algo completamente distinto: un rostro azabache y nácar.  </blockquote><br/><br/>¿Neta? ¿Neta? ¿Te cae? No sé qué me horroriza más: la noche que se dilata, o la reciedumbre de la tormenta, o los silencios horrorizados, o la agonía de la luz. Tal vez sean las viandas. O el novedosísimo binomio azabache-nácar, fresco como el rocío de la mañana.<br/><br/>Se preguntarán, claro está, cómo es que encontré tan selecta vianda entre un mar de libros que podría leer. Qué sapiente mentor me instó a derrochar mi tiempo en esta obra, heredera del linaje de las pésimas novelas de oscuras traducciones (nótese, por favor, el tan delectable adjetivo antes de sustantivo, fórmula segura de grandilocuencia y de descolocada anglofilia).<br/><br/>Vergüenza me da reconocer que mi ingenua confianza en la desdichada guía <i> 1001 Books You Must Read before You Die </i> fue la que me condujo a este aciago páramo. En estas oscuras épocas donde ya no sabe si tiene uno un vulgar catarro o una sentencia de muerte, pensé que sería buena idea dejarme guiar por una obra que pretende arrojar luz en semejante laberinto de la soledad (obra también recomendada, cabe destacar). Pérfido Virgilio, nefasto cicerone de las galerías infernales de la mediocre literatura comercial.<br/><br/>He leído alrededor de 40 páginas de esta basura y sé que es una tarea sinsentido. De todos modos, por pura disciplina (llámese masoquismo o la vaga esperanza de que habrá tal vez alguna línea que valga la pena) voy a terminar de leerlo, pero, eso sí, a un ritmo de una o dos páginas por día. <br/><br/>Lectura de baño que le dicen.",,,0,0

King I read. After reading <i>The Shining</i> I was rather curious of what other cheap tricks Mr. King had under his sleeve. I am afraid to tell, however, that this book is just 427 pages of pure rubbish. <br/>Set in a small town in Maine, <i>'Salem's Lot</i> is a reworking of <i>Dracula</i>. Although the Bram Stoker's classic can be a little slow and cumbersome at times, I would say that it is worth reading. This is not the case with <i>'Salem's Lot</i>: the prose is cheap and vulgar. It is clear that King was only trying to fill pages and pages with lame analogies and unnecessary information.<br/>Don't waste your time or money.<br/>",,,1,0
